# Some AI ML Tools
Some AI/ML tools written by me. I have not been very consistent in updating the codes here (I was busy with my coursework); but I intend to post most of my codes here as soon as possible. You may utilize these codes as per your convenience.

Currently, the resnet, U-Net and Efficient B0 models are completed or are near completion. I have tried to keep the code simple and have made them in the form of Jupyter Notebooks to make them easy to understand.
